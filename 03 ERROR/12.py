# Exception handling
    # Exception are errors and handling them so our code do not throw error on runtime
# For example:
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b
# Following function will throw error because it's performing unrealistic task
result = divide(10, 0)
# Output: ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
